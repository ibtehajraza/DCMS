# Distributed Computer Management Systems (DCMS)

This project is for the course of Distributed Systems.

In this project we are implemeting an RMI client server architecture with multiple distributed systems.

### What is RMI?

An RMI server is a program that hosts remote objects. An RMI registry is a separate program that binds remote object names to instances. An RMI server makes remote objects accessible to clients by registering them in the registry; clients then obtain access via that same registry.
